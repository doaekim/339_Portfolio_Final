          <h2> Research </h2>
          <p> I am being advised by Dr. Carol Flannagan. 
            Her research interests lie in data collection and big data analysis. 
            The research is focusing on developing strategies for automating video data extraction to record vehicle occupant behavior, as well as objects and actions in the vehicle’s forward view. 
            And I am currently working on developing algorithms to produce an unbiased comprehensive computer vision algorithm that can help research teams labeling data stored in images and video. 
            In all of these areas, there is a potential to introduce an unintended bias in the algorithms that could have negative societal implications (2021 ~).</p>

                      <span>[Putting the Human in Human Computer Interaction] </span></p>
                    <p>I compared the Super8 and Ritz Carlton hotel websites to analyze how their designs impact human capabilities and behavior and sketched modifications. 
                      I made modifications in terms of a fundamental design principle, motor behavior, attention, perception and memory.
                      For example, in the affordance aspect, I added affordance for users to access faster search result for those arriving at their
                      destination by making "Find Hotels Near Me" button/ function. 
                      It also works for people who is urgently looking for accomodation nearby.
                      In addition, the change that placed "Join" right next to "Sign in" makes signing-up easier for new users by adding the affordance.

                      <span>[Python]</span></p>
                    <p>  Web scraping is the process of taking messy data from the web, processing it, cleaning it, and turning it into something useful for analysis.
                      I scraped data taken from Goodreads.com, cleaning it, and extracting information from it. 
                      The BeautifulSoup library was used to parse through the HTML documents.
                      I also wrote the test cases for each one and open the websites, explore and get a sense of what my data should actually look like.

                    <p>The project is about how to deploy sensors, interpret data, and learn how communities interact with environmental sensor devices, data, and information.
                      Climate change and urbanization have caused problems such as flooding, stormwater runoff, and increased storm events have changed how policymakers, watershed managers, and citizens think about and interact with our water systems.
                      The Real Time Water Systems Lab works to enable the next generation of smart and adaptive water systems. 
                      And our team actively used the technologies such as wireless sensors and robotics, and data that has the potential to transform our urban environments.
                      The team is empowered to work with community stakeholders and craft solutions and tools, such as dashboards, that provide scalable management resources and solutions for the Huron River Watershed and the Clinton River Watershed.  </p>
