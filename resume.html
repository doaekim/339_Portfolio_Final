          <p class="heading">[One of the Group Works I have done in class]</p>
          <div class="content">
            <p> I practice how to design for universal users before the stage of aesthetic design using CSS and HTML. 
              The most recent activity I've done was, assuming that we purchase products from Amazon or Craigslist, to explain reactions to both sites' situations on a visual, and reflective level.
              Also, we created a high-light interlocking or signature differences between our independent reactions and users we have analyzed. 
              We made our new persona as children, rather than teens and adults. 
              This new competitor platform would be aiming to target kids 12 years and younger. </p>
              <div class="item">
                <p class="title">Visual level</p>
                <p> When searching for a jean jacket on Amazon, the perceptible qualities that we noticed in informing our decisions when searching is the color of the jean jacket, the size/length of the jacket based on the product thumbnail, particularly styling of the jacket, what is featured on the jean jacket (pockets, collars, etc.).
                  On the left side of the page, there is a filters section that helps customers find the jean jacket that fits their needs and styling. 
                  For the children-friendly design, our new design provides brighter colors to the site and the overall visual design. 
                  The children would want an easy-to-understand. 
                  So we designed a new Interface design via Figma, by having simple content with less information. </p>
            </div>
              <div class="item">                      
                <p class="title">Behavioral level</p>
                  <p>The simple “ADD TO CART” and shopping cart logo button is simple for children to understand how to add an item to their shopping cart.
                    Removing any unnecessary texts, links, reviews eliminates any functions or features that do not support the main functionality of the site (Buying a jacket).
                    In the search process, instead of text results, the site gives children various images of different types of jackets to choose from.
                    This increases the ease-of-use for children as they don’t need to type in specific types of coats, but rather, the site gives them images to pick from.
                  </p>
              </div>
              <div class="item">
                <p class="title">Reflective level</p>
                  <p> Having product images of other children wearing the jean jackets might give the impression to the children viewing the items that these are popular and may bring them “prestige” among their peers. 
                    Additionally, making use of icons such as a shopping cart throughout this digital experience can trigger memories of children shopping in a physical store and adding items into the shopping cart.</p>
